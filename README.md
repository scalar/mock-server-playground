## Usage

### Setup

1. Open [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/scalar/mock-server-playground) in your browser
2. Create a new Codespace by clicking the green "Code" button and selecting "Codespaces" → "Create codespace on main"
3. Wait for setup (dependencies are installed automatically)
4. Server starts automatically

### Playing with the Mock Server

1. Open the "Ports" tab in VS Code to find the URL
2. Click on the port forwarding URL (port 3000) to open it in the browser
3. You'll see the Scalar API Reference
4. Use the built-in API client to test endpoints and see mock responses

### Making Changes

- Update `documents/example.yaml` to modify the API definition
- The server restarts when you save changes
- Simply refresh the browser to see your changes
